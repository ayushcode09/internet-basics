How the Internet Works
======================
-> The Internet is a global network of computers that communicate with each other using predefined rules called protocols.
  - Internet: infrastructure (cables, routers, servers).
  - Web: services that runs on the internet (websites, web apps).

-> History of Web
  - Web 1.0 (~1990s - early 2000s)
    • only static websites where user can only read nothing else.
    • no login/signup, comments, likes or sharing.
    • content is created by websites owners only.

  - Web 2.0 (~early 2000s - 2010s)
    • interactive and dynamic web.
    • users can create, share, and interact with content.
    • features like login/signup, comments, likes, shares.
    • user data is controlled by company/website owners.

  - Web 3.0 (~2010s - Present)
    • blockchain-based and decentralized.
    • users own and control their data.
    • uses smart contracts and crypto wallets instead of traditional logins.
    • still evolving and not fully adopted yet.

-> How computers communicate with each other
  - Computers communicate using binary data (0s and 1s).
  - To understand each other, computers follow fixed rules called protocols.
  - Protocols define:
    • how data is sent
    • how data is received
    • how data is interpreted

  - Common Protocols:
    • HTTP / HTTPS: used for web communication.
    • TCP/IP: used to send data reliably over the internet.

-> How computers send data all over the world
  - Data is not sent as a whole, it is broken into small parts called packets and it contains:
    • source IP
    • destination IP
    • sequence number
    • payload (actual data)

  - Each packet travels through different paths on the internet, moving from one router to another. Each jump between routers is called a "hop".
  - Routers help packets choose the best path (least "hops" or fastest route) to reach the destination.
  - At the destination, packets are reassembled to form the original data.
  - This makes communication
    • fast
    • reliable

-> Domain Name
  - A domain name is a human readable address of a website.
  - It is easier to remember than numeric IP addresses.
  - Example
    • google.com
    • youtube.com

  - Domain names are mapped to IP addresses using DNS.

-> IP Address (Internet Protocol)
  - An IP address is a unique numeric identifier assigned to every device on the internet.
  - It helps identify and locate devices on a network.
  - Example
    • 142.250.195.14

  - Types of IP address
    • IPv4 (older, limited addresses)
    • IPv6 (newer, vastly more addresses to handle the growing number of devices online, as IPv4 addresses were running out)

-> MAC Address
  - A MAC address is a unique hardware address of a network device.
  - It is assigned by the manufacturer.
  - It is mostly used inside local networks (LAN).
  - MAC address is hardware based and usually permanent, but can be spoofed.

-> Routing
  - Routing is the process of selecting the best path for data to travel.
  - Routers perform routing on the internet.
  - If one path fails, routers automatically choose another path.
  - This helps data reach its destination efficiently.

-> ISP (Internet Service Provider)
  - An ISP is a company that provides internet access to users.
  - ISP connects user devices to the global internet.
  - ISP responsibilities
    • provide internet connection
    • assign IP address
    • transfer data between user and server

  - Examples
    • Jio
    • Airtel

-> DNS (Domain Name System)
  - DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.
  - Computers use IP addresses, not domain names.
  - Example
    • google.com (2404:6800:4002:817::200e)

  - DNS works like a phonebook of the internet.

-> How ISP and DNS work together
  - User enters a domain name in the browser.
  - Browser (or the OS, on behalf of the browser) first sends a request to a DNS resolver (usually provided by the ISP) to find the IP address of the domain.
  - DNS returns the IP address to the browser.
  - Browser then directly connects to the server using that IP address (sometimes through the ISP's network).
  - Data is sent back to the browser and website loads.
