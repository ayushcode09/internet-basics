Client-Server Architecture
==========================
-> Client-Server Model
  - The client server model is an architecture where two or more systems communicate with each other over a network.
  - The client sends requests for data or services.
  - The server receives those requests, processes them, and sends responses.
  - A single server can handle requests from multiple clients simultaneously.

-> Client (Browser) vs Server (Hosting Computer)
  - Client
    • used by user (Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Edge).
    • sends HTTP/HTTPS requests to the server.
    • receives responses and displays the website.
    • cannot access database directly.

  - Server
    • remote computer that hosts the website.
    • stores website files and data.
    • listens for incoming client requests.
    • processes requests and sends responses.
    • has access to databases and server-side resources.

-> HTTP Request and Response Cycle
  - Browser and server communicate using HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
  - Request
    • browser sends a request to the server.
    • request contains URL, method (e.g., GET, POST), headers and data.

  - Processing
    • server receives the request.
    • server runs backend logic.
    • server may fetch data from database.

  - Response
    • server sends response back to browser.
    • response contains status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error), headers and data.

  - Render
    • browser receives the response.
    • browser parses HTML, applies CSS, and executes JavaScript.
    • website is rendered on the user’s screen.

-> What happens when you visit a website
  - User enters a URL in the browser.
  - Browser finds the IP address using DNS.
  - Browser sends HTTP request to the server.
  - Server processes the request.
  - Server sends response back to browser.
  - Browser renders the website on the screen.

-> Front-end vs Back-end
  - Front-end
    • visible part of the website.
    • runs in the browser.
    • built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    • handles user interaction and UI.

  - Back-end
    • hidden part of the website.
    • runs on the server.
    • handles logic, authentication, and data.
    • works with databases and APIs (e.g., Python/Django, Node.js/Express, PHP/Laravel).

-> Static Websites
  - Static websites show fixed content.
  - Same content is shown to every user.
  - Static websites usually do not require a database.
  - Content does not change automatically.
  - Examples
    • portfolio website
    • landing page

-> Dynamic Websites
  - Dynamic websites show changing content.
  - Content depends on user or data.
  - Uses server-side logic and database.
  - Examples
    • social media websites
    • e-commerce websites

-> Web Hosting
  - Web hosting is a service that stores website files on a server.
  - Hosting makes a website accessible on the internet.
  - Hosting provider gives
    • server space
    • IP address
    • internet connectivity

-> How web hosting works
  - Website files are uploaded to a hosting server.
  - Server is connected to the internet 24/7.
  - Domain name points to the server IP.
  - When user visits the domain, server sends website files.
